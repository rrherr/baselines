    "\n",
    "### About me\n",
    "\n",
    "[My data science career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-herr-b5a8a77/) began at State Farm, a Fortune 50 insurance company. I started learning in 2012 and officially earned the title in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of 20 data scientists on their inaugural team, I was one of only two with just a Bachelor’s degree. I didn’t have the time, money, or geographic mobility for a “traditional” Master’s, but didn’t let that stop me from changing careers...\n",
    "\n",
    "### My mentor's advice\n",
    "\n",
    "It's amazing how much information is online, but it can be overwhelming to sift through. So I was fortunate to find a [mentor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-sanchez-62093847/) to help point me in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "[He taught me](https://youtu.be/0GrciaGYzV0?t=40s):\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Your first goal should always, always, always be getting a generalized prediction as fast as possible.*** You shouldn't spend a lot of time trying to tune your model, trying to add features, trying to engineer features, until you've actually gotten one prediction, at least. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The reason why that's a really good thing is because then ***you'll set a benchmark*** for yourself, and you'll be able to directly see how much effort you put in translates to a better prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "> What you'll find by working on many models: some effort you put in, actually has very little effect on how well your final model does at predicting new observations. Whereas some very easy changes actually have a lot of effect. And so you get better at allocating your time more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From advice to examples\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply this advice, it's helpful to see examples in code. My mentor made a [video](https://youtu.be/0GrciaGYzV0), but it's 3.5 years old and out-of-date. The advice is timeless, but code is not! Thankfully, today we can build baselines even faster. I teach an updated method in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "My mentor's advice is echoed and elaborated in several sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Always start with a stupid model, no exceptions](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/always-start-with-a-stupid-model-no-exceptions-3a22314b9aaa)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why start with a baseline? A baseline will take you less than 1/10th of the time, and could provide up to 90% of the results. A baseline puts a more complex model into context. Baselines are easy to deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Measure Once, Cut Twice: Moving Towards Iteration in Data Science](https://blog.datarobot.com/measure-once-cut-twice-moving-towards-iteration-in-data-science)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The iterative approach in data science starts with emphasizing the importance of getting to a first model quickly, rather than starting with the variables and features. Once the first model is built, the work then steadily focuses on continual improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [*Data Science for Business*](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/data-science-for/9781449374273/), Chapter 7.3: Evaluation, Baseline Performance, and Implications for Investments in Data\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Consider carefully what would be a reasonable baseline against which to compare model performance.* This is important for the data science team in order to understand whether they indeed are improving performance, and is equally important for demonstrating to stakeholders that mining the data has added value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, I will take excerpts from these sources. However, they don't contain any code — so I will add examples to demonstrate the advice in action.\n",

There are many cases where smart, analytical people have been tripped up in skipping over this basic comparison.

So, the simple majority prediction classifier also would have an accuracy of 94%.\n",
